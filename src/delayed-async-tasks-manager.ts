/**
 * DelayedAsyncTasksManager
 * 
 * A one-time scheduler for asynchronous tasks, designed to manage delayed executions
 * of multiple tasks. Each task is identified by a unique user-defined key, preventing
 * redundant scheduling.
 * 
 * ### Key Features
 * - Status getters to track the taskâ€™s execution state.
 * - Ability to abort a specific pending task (by key) or all pending tasks.
 * - Gracefully await the completion of a specific or all ongoing tasks.
 * - Captures uncaught errors, accessible via the `extractUncaughtErrors` method.
 * - Fully covered by unit tests.
 * - No runtime dependencies; only dev-dependencies for testing.
 * - TypeScript support, targeting ES2020.
 * 
 * ### Motivation
 * The built-in `setTimeout` function lacks proper handling of asynchronous tasks (Promises), 
 * particularly for tracking their execution status (pending, executing, fulfilled or rejected).
 * Additionally, `setTimeout` does not offer an out-of-the-box mechanism to await the completion
 * of an asynchronous task that has already started.
 * Graceful termination is often required to ensure a clean state, such as between unit tests where
 * we want to avoid any tasks from previous tests running in the background.
 * The `DelayedAsyncTasksManager` class addresses these gaps by managing the lifecycle of tasks and
 * their promises. It stores uncaught errors, preventing them from bubbling to the event loop, thus
 * enabling more robust asynchronous task scheduling for complex scenarios.
